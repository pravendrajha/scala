Polygon --super class 
rect -- sub class
Tr --subclass 


Abstract class --> Restrict the instantiation of Super class 
& defines the methods which can used by inheriting subclass

method does not hav any body called abstract method

if a class does have atleast one abstract method then class must be declared as abstract class 


Scala does not allowed multiple inheritance .

traits are partially interfaces , they can contain both
atleast one method should be abstract in trait 
trait can have both abstract & non abstract methods 
when u are inheriting from traits we can remove override and it will work without any issue 



Option give some or None . 

if the value find then retrun 1st result else return none instance
